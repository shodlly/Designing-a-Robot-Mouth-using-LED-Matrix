# Designing-a-Robot-Mouth-using-LED-Matrix
This repository demonstrates the design of a robot mouth using an LED matrix. The matrix is controlled by an Arduino board in conjunction with the MAX7219 chip, enabling precise control over each LED. The repository includes a basic animation that displays a smiling face on the LED matrix.
